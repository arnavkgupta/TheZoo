    As the number of endangered animal species nears one million worldwide, the severity of the crisis is escalating every day. However, there is hope for change. High school and college students can become the leaders of this change by accessing the necessary resources. Habitat, a website tailored for students, aims to guide them with personalized resources based on their interests and hobbies, which they can incorporate into their daily lives. Our goal is to raise awareness among students about the urgency of the crisis and inspire them to make sustainable changes to help protect our ecosystems.
