Data displayed from the year 1978 to 2018 shows the progression of the total number of threatened species, increasing from approximately 200 to over 1,600. Click on any of the years to view the number of threatened species for that specific time. You can click on the replay button to view the line animation again as well! </p>

The more red the country the more amount of threatened species it has. Hovering over the countries will allow you to see the number of the select metric for that specific country. The search button in the upper right corner allows you to input a country and see its metric.</p>

            <p id="animal_paragraph" style= "font-family: Rubik; font-size: 1.3em; color: rgba(61,83,39,1); font-weight: bold;">Our planet faces a global extinction crisis that has never been seen before. According to scientists, they predict more than one million species are on track for extinction in the coming decades. If extinction were to happen, entire ecosystems would be at an imbalance and humans would be unable to sustain their ways of life. Because habitats and food chains would be disrupted, resources such as food and water would be unattainable. As the relationship between nature and human lives are codependent, we as humans would not be able to take care of ourselves if animal endangerment is not addressed. Many people are ignorant of the impact that day to day life has on wildlife populations with the choices one makes at a grocery store, what products they purchase, and even where trash is thrown away; all of these decisions impact the natural world around us. Without further knowledge, people would be unaware that making sustainable lifestyle changes could further protect endangered animals.</p>
